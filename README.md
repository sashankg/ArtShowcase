## Background
The app is designed to make it easier for artists living in the same area to connect. Houston Art Showcase is a nonprofit organization that hosts competitions for artists and brings together. While I was working with them, I started development of this app that had 3 main functionalities:
- Learn: Lessons for painting, sketching, and other forms of art in the form of video tutorials and written instructions
- Meet Up: Events that are coming up that artists can participate in, including competitions, galleries, and conferences
- Share: Post pictures of the artist's work so that others can see and the artist can gain more exposure

## Technology
- Coded in Swift for the iOS platform
- Prototyped in Sketch
- Parse for backend
- MVVM application architecture
- Reactive Cocoa for Functional Reactive Paradigm
- Facebook Login
